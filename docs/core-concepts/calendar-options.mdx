# Calendar Options
CalendarOptions is a configuration interface, used for the initialization and control of the calendar instance’s functionality. There is a wide range of options that can only be accessed through this interface. These options deal with the way the calendar should look when the page is initially loaded, time, and date-related options, as well as options for the notification of changes through the use of callback functions.

Each option is thoroughly explained in this document, along with its function, default behavior, and real-world application examples.

```ts
export interface CalendarOptions {
    defaultView?: ViewType;
    defaultDate?: Date;

    timeSlotInterval?: number;
    startHour?: number; // from 1 to 23
    endHour?: number; // from 2 to 24
    initialEvents?: CalendarEvent[];
    timezone?: string;
    locale?: string;
    onEvent?: (events: CalendarEvent[]) => void;
    onEventCreate?: (event: CalendarEvent) => void;
    onEventUpdate?: (event: CalendarEvent) => void;
    onEventDelete?: (event: CalendarEvent) => void;
    onViewChange?: (view: ViewType) => void;
