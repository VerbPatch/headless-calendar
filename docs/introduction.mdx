# Introduction

Headless Calendar is a powerful, unstyled, and highly customizable engine for building calendar and scheduling experiences in your JavaScript applications.

## The "Headless" Philosophy

Inspired by the "headless" UI component trend, this library provides all the logic, state management, and functionality for a calendar, but without any pre-built UI components. This gives you complete control over the markup and styling, allowing you to create a calendar that perfectly matches your application's design system.

## Why Headless Calendar?

Many calendar libraries are tied to a specific UI framework, forcing developers to search for alternatives when working outside that ecosystem. This often leads to using components that lack features or don't align with project requirements.

Headless Calendar solves this problem by providing a framework-agnostic core logic written in plain TypeScript. We then offer thin, reactive wrappers for popular frameworks like React, Vue, Svelte, and more. This approach allows you to:

* **Write once, use anywhere**: Use the same core calendar logic across different frameworks.
* **Maintain consistency**: Ensure consistent behavior and features, regardless of the technology stack.
* **Avoid vendor lock-in**: Easily migrate between frameworks without rewriting your calendar logic.

## Core Features

* **Framework-Agnostic Core**: The central logic is written in plain TypeScript, allowing integration into any JavaScript framework.
